--------------------------

In the folder `DATA_paper_CDR`, the data used for the different figures is stored. The files are organized into subfolders 
according to the specific figure they relate to. 

Regarding the data for **Figure 1**, it may require an older version of Spyder (e.g., 4.2) to open correctly.

**IMPORTANT REMARK:**  
The data stored in these files was generated using earlier versions of the scripts. Therefore, some variables—such as
`J`—may appear as `R` or similar. However, the important data is stored with the same names in both the old and current 
versions. As a result, this mismatch should not pose a problem when generating the plots.

**Specific information about the data:**

- **Figure 1:**  
  The files `N_1K_MERGED_0_1000.spydata` and `N_infty_MERGED_0_1000.spydata` contain the final data in the variable `loss_circuits`.  
  The other files are auxiliary, created because the numerical experiments were run in different threads, generating separate files. 
  These were later combined into the merged files mentioned above.

- **Figure 2 and 3a:**  
  The file `All_data_figure_2_3a.spydata` contains all the necessary data for Figures 2 and 3a. As before, the remaining files are 
  auxiliary ones generated by different threads (since the program was run in parallel).

- **Figure 3b:**  
  The different files store results for various values of `N`. For instance, `data_N_100K.spydata` stores the errors for N = 100K 
  (except for the ZNE-insertion method with `J_2 = 6`, which is stored in `data_N_100K_J_2_6.spydata`).  
  The resulting values for different numbers of shots are stored in the script `script_figure_3b_plot.py`.

- **Figure 5a:**  
  The file `N_1k_QFT.spydata` contains the data for N = 1k, while `N_inf_QFT.spydata` contains the data for N → ∞.

- **Figure 5b:**  
  The files store results for different noise levels `p`. For example, `p_inf_0_01.spydata` contains the estimates for `p = 0.01` using `N = ∞` shots.  
  **Important:** Files with `_non_corrected` in the name contain results for the non correction method. This was necessary because the data was originally
  generated using an older version of the script `script_figure_5b.py`, which did not include the non-corrected option.

The file `library_QEM.py` contains the main functions and is imported by the other scripts. The rest of the files are named according to the figure they are 
associated with, either to generate data or to create plots.
